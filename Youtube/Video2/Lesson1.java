//Procedural vs Object-Oriented Programming

//---> Procedural-Oriented Programming (POP)


/*Focus: Emphasizes functions and the sequence of tasks to be performed.

Approach: Breaks down a program into functions that operate on data. The data and functions are separate entities.
Key Idea: It focuses on "what needs to be done" by defining procedures or steps.

Example:
Functions like withdraw(), deposit(), and transfer() are created to perform specific tasks.
Data (e.g., account balance) is passed to these functions as needed.

Perspective: Looks at the processes or actions to be executed.
*/


//----> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)


/* Focus: Emphasizes objects that combine data and functions (methods) into a single unit.

Approach: Identifies real-world entities (objects) and assigns them relevant data (attributes) and behaviors (methods).
Key Idea: It focuses on "who is involved" by modeling objects and their interactions.

Example:
Objects like Customer, Money, and Account are defined.
A Customer might have data (e.g., name, ID) and methods (e.g., withdraw(), deposit()).
An Account might contain data (e.g., balance) and methods (e.g., transfer()).

Perspective: Looks at the entities involved and how they relate to each other.
